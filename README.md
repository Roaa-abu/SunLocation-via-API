# SunLocation-via-API
This ASP.NET Core MVC project determines the current time of day based on the user's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) by querying the TimeZoneDB API. It processes the API response to extract the local time, then selects an appropriate image (e.g., sunrise, morning, noon, evening, night, or sunset) that visually represents the current time. The image is dynamically passed from the backend to the frontend and displayed in the view. The project demonstrates integration with an external API, time parsing logic, and clean MVC separation for a user-friendly visualization of the sun's position throughout the day.
